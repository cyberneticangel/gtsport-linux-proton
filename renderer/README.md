# Renderer changes (shadGT, branch `ryty-gpu`)

The renderer (`libSceVideoOut.prx`) is built from
[shadGT, branch `ryty-gpu`](https://github.com/mlgprorektm8/shadGT/tree/ryty-gpu). Changes made
after shadGT commit `29af7ca6` are kept here as patches, in order (the branch itself includes all of them from
commit `4371a500`):

| Patch | What it adds |
|---|---|
| `0001-ryGT-frame-generation-...` | AMD FSR 3.1.4 frame generation, shader precompile on the splash screen (with a progress bar), pausing the game while new shaders compile, compile batching, efficiency-core shader compiles, opt-in diagnostics |
| `0002-ryGT-splash-screen-shows-...` | Hotfix: the splash screen and progress bar show while the game waits for the precompile (it was a black screen) |
| `0003-ryGT-Lewis-Hamilton-Time-Trial-...` | GTS-002: unlocks the Lewis Hamilton Time Trial Challenge in the Campaign menu (the add-on's unlock flags came from the shut-down servers); `RYGT_LEWIS=0` turns it off |
| `0004-ryGT-Livery-Editor-offline-GTS-003` | GTS-003: enables the Livery button on the main menu while offline (the menu script greyed it out without the servers; the editor has its own offline mode that saves liveries locally); `RYGT_LIVERY=0` turns it off |
| `0005-ryGT-effects-fix-frame-generation-...` | Dust, smoke and rain no longer show pink and black rectangles (the game's clears of reused effect memory ran as skipped "mask clears"); frame generation starts after the splash screen (it could freeze the precompile); slow-motion shader compiles; freeze and frame-capture diagnostics |
| `0006-ryGT-on-screen-keyboard-offline-livery-...` | On-screen keyboard for text fields, whole-script replacements from `patches\scripts` (GTS-005), custom decals from the `decals` folder (GTS-006) |
| `0007-ryGT-renderer-speed-work-2026-10-15` | Recorder speed-ups (fence writes through cached aliases, texture lookup memo), the decoder's shader search tries the last match first, early-fence deadlock fixes, and the opt-in multithreaded groundwork (per-thread draw state and command rings, buffer stage workers, shared buffer-cache lock) with ceiling and timeline diagnostics |
| `0008-ryGT-direct-memory-renderer-2026-10-16` | The new renderer (launcher option "New renderer", `GPU.direct_renderer`, or `SHADGT_DIRECT=1`): shaders read game memory in place through a GPU page table over imported guest memory instead of copying buffers every draw (Tokyo rain benchmark about 32 -> 43 fps); freed render targets are reused instead of rebuilt (all modes); wet-road reflection (GTS-007) and half-rate mirror (GTS-008) toggles; texture-binding shortcuts; import prototype, ceiling and timing diagnostics |
| `0009-ryGT-buffer-stage-with-direct-renderer` | With the new renderer, a helper thread fetches the remaining (copied) buffers ahead of the draw recorder (about +1.5 fps in the Tokyo rain benchmark) |
| `0010-ryGT-framegen-compile-freeze-fix` | Frame generation pauses while new shaders compile (with it on, heavy compiling could freeze the game in the driver); timing switches for the command thread and pipeline selection |
| `0011-ryGT-quality-preset-memory` | The reused-image pool size follows the launcher's quality preset (`GPU.image_recycle_mb`) |
| `0012-ryGT-old-shader-fallback-direct-default` | The new renderer is the only renderer (`SHADGT_DIRECT=0` for comparisons); while its own shaders and pipelines are built in the background, draws use the old renderer's stored shaders, so switching causes no shader-compile freezes |
| `0019-ghost-quad-sample-mask` | Per-quad sample coverage masks restore recorded ghost transparency; ordinary shader caches remain compatible |
| `0020-proton-refused-imports` | Proton on AMD: when the driver refuses to import guest memory 16 times before any view is imported, the direct renderer stops asking and logs it once (each try mapped an alias and asked the kernel to pin it) |
| `0021-unique-function-copies` | `Common::UniqueFunction` stores a copy of a named functor instead of a reference to it. The occlusion-results writer was recorded that way, and the recorder ran it after the decoder had left its scope: GT Sport races could crash in `shadGT:GpuRecorder` |

To build: check out shadGT at `29af7ca6`, apply the patches with
`git am <RyGT>/renderer/shadGT-patches/*.patch`, then build the `ryty_gpu` target as in the main
README (`cmake --preset x64-Clang-Release -DSHADGT_RYTY_GPU=ON`).
